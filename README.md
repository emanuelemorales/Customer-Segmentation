# Customer-Segmentation

The aim of the project is to analyse data related to a wholesale distributor and to obtain a segmentation of its customers based on the annual amount of money spent by the buyers on the different categories of products.  

The work is divided into three main parts:

-	Data exploration and identification of outliers through Mahalanobis distance. 
-	Data dimensionality reduction:  Multidimensional Scaling and PCA techniques. 
-	Clustering: k-mean and model-based clustering.
