# Customer-Segmentation

The aim of the project is to analyse data related to a wholesale distributor and to obtain a segmentation of its customers based on the annual amount of money spent by the buyers on the different categories of products.  
The work is divided into three main parts:
-	a first part in which data are explored and outliers are identified by applying Mahalanobis distance. 
-	In the second part data dimensionality is reduced using Multidimensional Scaling and PCA techniques, in order to have proper visualization of data on a 2d/3d plot. 
-	Finally two techniques of clustering are applied to identify the type of customers: k-mean and model-based clustering.
